| As most folks are these days, I'm online in a lot of different places. I try to avoid most of the worst offenders with it comes to data privacy and dark patterns, but I'm also only a human. I am a big believer in the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) in most of it's various forms, so I tend to mainly post there. | A big part of my interactions online happen on [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)), a part of the Fediverse that most resembles Twitter. I post over on [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/) as benpocalypse, and mainly share all my usual nerdy projects and updates there. I love seeing what new and interesting things folks are working on, so if you've got something to share, definitely reach out to me there. | I am fairly active on Matrix chat at [matrix.org](https://matrix.org/) as benpocalypse99. It's a pretty nice, open alternative to things like Slack or Discord. I mostly hang out in programming related channels, but feel free to send me a direct message if you're so inclined. |

| I also keep a fairly poorly maintained set of [Github repositories](https://github.com/benpocalypse) if you're interested in seeing any of my various projects source code. And definitely feel free to open issues, post suggestions, or fork away. Comments and constructive criticism are always welcome. | And, although it's certainly not as popular as something such as Instagram or any of the other proprietary photo sharing sites, I often post pictures over at [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social) a part of the larger Fediverse. Mainly personal pictures and sometimes behind the scenes pictures of my projects, but nothing too bonkers. Overall, I really like Pixelfed and hope to see it continue to iterate and grow as a platform. |

### Email
And last, but not least, you can email me at ben dot foote at protonmail dot com if you're so inclined, but I'm fairly bad at responding in a timely manner there. (There's a reason I put this at the end.)
