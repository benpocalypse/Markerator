# Soft launch
The official first Bengineering post has arrived.

After working a bunch behind the scenes to get my static site generator up to snuff, I am ready to call this the first official version of the Bengineering site. I plan to refactor and add features to Markerator to make it fit for general consumption, but for now it suits my needs fairly well.

As I continue to work on this as well as other projects, I hope to keep the updates to the site flowing. Here's hoping.
