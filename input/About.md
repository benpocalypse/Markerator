## About Me
My name is Ben, and for as long as I've had a computer I've felt the compulsion to make projects with them. I'm roughly 42 years old, and have been a professional programmer by day, and a project-doer by night for most of my life. I mainly specialize in C#/.Net, but have done lots of C, C++, and Vala as well. I'm a big Linux enthusiast, and have used some flavor of it as my primary desktop OS since the late 90's.

Over the years I've had various levels of success at completing my projects, but have finally decided that I need to better catalog and track these projects. This website is my attempt to do just that.

Lately, my kids have become a bigger part of these projects, so I expect to add things I do with them here as well. In fact, they probably wish I had more time to do the projects they'd like to have help with, but hey, there are only so many hours in a day.
