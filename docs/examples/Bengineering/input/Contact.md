## Contact Information
As most folks are these days, I'm online in a lot of different places. I try to avoid most of the worst offenders with it comes to data privacy and dark patterns, but I'm also only human. I am a big believer in the Fediverse in most of it's various forms, so I tend to mainly post there.

You can email me at ben dot foote at protonmail dot com if you're so inclined, but I'm fairly bad at responding in a timely manner there.

I also keep a set of fairly poorly maintained Github repositories if you're interested in seeing any of my various projects source code.
